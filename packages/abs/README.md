# App Bundle Server (ABS)

When an application is deployed, artifacts like JavaScript files, images, stylesheets, and so on are generated by Hypertool. These artifacts are collectively called as app bundles. App bundles are stored in Google Cloud Storage.

Users need a way to access their apps via a simple URL. This is where App Bundle Server comes in to play. It allows users to access their apps at `*.hypertool.io` or custom domains.

ABS is a layer in front of GCS. It resolves the GCS object URLs based on the domain name in the HTTP request and redirects the client.
