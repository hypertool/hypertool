Hypertool is an open-source low code platform that helps you build internal
tools quickly. You can integrate apps with your databases, APIs, spreadsheets,
and other apps.

With our JavaScript-based visual development platform, build CRUD apps, forms,
dashboards, admin panels, and many more 10x faster. It is designed for developers
by developers.

Hypertool combines multiple components to provide a simple interface for building
internal tools. Here are a few highlights:
