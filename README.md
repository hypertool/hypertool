Hypertool is a low-code platform for building internal tools quickly.

Hypertool combines multiple components to provide a simple interface for building
tools. Here are a few highlights:

-   File-system based router designed for client-side rendering
-   Safe data access layer for clients via query engine
-   Automated deployments to Kubernetes clusters
-   Authorization via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
-   Google OAuth2 and basic authentication mechanisms
-   Team Management

NOTE: As of now, Node.js 17.x is unsupported.
