# The problems with building internal tools

As developers ourselves, we have closely worked with many different teams to
build internal tools. Non-tech teams use spreadsheets to track data, use
third-party tools to analyze data, and need internal tools for business-specific
operations.

## Cannot move fast

If your company teaches science to students, spending majority of your time
building internal tools does not make sense. Instead you should focus on
providing your core services.

## Repetitive tasks

Even if the internal tool is used by a small team, authentication, authorization,
audit logging, and other such mundane features are important. Implementing all of
this requires a lot of human resources and caffeine! At a point, building internal
tools becomes repetitive and boring.

## Maintenance is a hassle

Developers are usually excited to build new projects. When they are working on
a fresh codebase they can build and iterate quickly. The problem is when the
tool is unused for a few months but is needed now, and the original developer
has moved on to another project, so there is no one to update and fix the tool.
