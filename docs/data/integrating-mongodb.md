# Integrating MongoDB

MongoDB is a powerful database system that powers thousands of applications.
You can integrate MongoDB with Hypertool by creating a resource in just a few
clicks.

## Creating MongoDB Resource

To create a new MongoDB resource, click on the "Create New Resource" button
in the Explorer tab. (If the "Resources" accordion is collapsed, you will need
to expand it to find the "Create New Resource" button.) This will open the New
Resource tab.

You will be asked to select your resource type. Choose "MongoDB" and click
"Next" in the bottom right.

After selecting the resource type, you will be asked to configure the database
connection. Fill the form correctly and click "Create Resource" in the bottom
right to create the resource.

That's it! You can now read and write to your database using query templates.
