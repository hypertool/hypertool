# Advantages of Hypertool

## Build applications with powerful features

Hypertool gives you everything you need out of the box: component library,
routing, authentication, authorization, team management, audit logging, automated
deployment pipelines, and a lot more!

## Manage your apps from the terminal

Hypertool CLI is light-weight and does not have high system requirements. All
you need is NodeJS installed on your machine. Hypertool can be installed using
NPM or Yarn, and takes just a few seconds to be up and running.

## Built for developers with GitOps in mind

App definitions, configurations, and environments are declarative and version
controlled. Deployments and lifecycle management of your apps are automated,
auditable, and easy to understand.

## Avoid vendor lock-in with Hypertool

Our community edition is open source and hosted on GitHub. In the long
run, if Hypertool does not meet your requirements, you can always eject your
project from Hypertool without throwing away everything.
