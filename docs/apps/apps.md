# Apps

An app provides an interface for the user to interact with your platform on
Android, iOS, and web.

Apps created with Hypertool are single-page applications (SPAs). You could create
SPAs with JavaScript libraries such as React, Angular, Vue, and so on. In fact,
Hypertool itself is written in React. The advantage of using Hypertool over other
libraries is that routing, deployment, and other such mundanes things are taken
care of, allowing you to focus on things that matter: your business logic.

You can create Hypertool apps in just a few clicks.

## Creating App

To create a new app, navigate to [View Applications](https://hypertool.io/apps)
screen. Click on the "Create New" button in the workspace toolbar. Alternatively,
you can navigate to [New App](https://hypertool.io/apps/new) screen directly.

You will be asked to fill in name, title, and description for your app.

-   The name specifies a handle that uniquely identifies the app across Hypertool.
    Remember, the name should be unique across Hypertool, not just your organization
    or account. This is because your app will be provisioned a subdomain with the
    app name you specify. For example, if your app name is `hello-world`, your app
    will be hosted at `https://hello-world.hypertool.io/`.

-   The title specifies the text that is used to display the app in launchers
    and other such places.

-   You can describe the functionality of the app using the optional description
    field.

After filling in the details, click "Next" in the bottom right to continue.

Next, select a template for your app. Templates allow to clone other apps. After
selecting the template, click "Create App" to create the app.

That's it! You can now add resources, query templates, screens, and controllers
to bring your app to life.
